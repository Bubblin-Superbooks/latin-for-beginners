<h4 id="preface">PREFACE</h4>
<p>To make the course preparatory to Cæsar at the same time systematic, thorough, clear, and interesting is the purpose of this series of lessons.</p>
<p>The first pages are devoted to a brief discussion of the Latin language, its history, and its educational value. The body of the book, consisting of seventy-nine lessons, is divided into three parts.</p>
<h2 id="part-i-is-devoted-to-pronunciation-quantity-accent-and-kindred-introductory-essentials">Part I is devoted to pronunciation, quantity, accent, and kindred introductory essentials.</h2>
<h2 id="part-ii-carries-the-work-through-the-first-sixty-lessons-and-is-devoted-to-the-study-of-forms-and-vocabulary-together-with-some-elementary-constructions-a-knowledge-of-which-is-necessary-for-the-translation-of-the-exercises-and-reading-matter-the-first-few-lessons-have-been-made-unusually-simple-to-meet-the-wants-of-pupils-not-well-grounded-in-english-grammar">Part II carries the work through the first sixty lessons, and is devoted to the study of forms and vocabulary, together with some elementary constructions, a knowledge of which is necessary for the translation of the exercises and reading matter. The first few lessons have been made unusually simple, to meet the wants of pupils not well grounded in English grammar.</h2>
<h2 id="part-iii-contains-nineteen-lessons-and-is-concerned-primarily-with-the-study-of-syntax-and-of-subjunctive-and-irregular-verb-forms-the-last-three-of-these-lessons-constitute-a-review-of-all-the-constructions-presented-in-the-book-there-is-abundant-easy-reading-matter-and-in-order-to-secure-proper-concentration-of-effort-upon-syntax-and-translation-no-new-vocabularies-are-introduced-but-the-vocabularies-in-part-ii-are-reviewed">Part III contains nineteen lessons, and is concerned primarily with the study of syntax and of subjunctive and irregular verb forms. The last three of these lessons constitute a review of all the constructions presented in the book. There is abundant easy reading matter; and, in order to secure proper concentration of effort upon syntax and translation, no new vocabularies are introduced, but the vocabularies in Part II are reviewed.</h2>
<p>It is hoped that the following features will commend themselves to teachers:</p>
<p>The forms are presented in their natural sequence, and are given, for the most part, in the body of the book as well as in a grammatical appendix. The work on the verb is intensive in character, work in other directions being reduced to a minimum while this is going on. The forms of the subjunctive are studied in correlation with the subjunctive constructions.</p>
<p>vi The vocabulary has been selected with the greatest care, using Lodge’s “Dictionary of Secondary Latin” and Browne’s “Latin Word List” as a basis. There are about six hundred words, exclusive of proper names, in the special vocabularies, and these are among the simplest and commonest words in the language. More than ninety-five per cent of those chosen are Cæsarian, and of these more than ninety per cent are used in Cæsar five or more times. The few words not Cæsarian are of such frequent occurrence in Cicero, Vergil, and other authors as to justify their appearance here. But teachers desiring to confine word study to Cæsar can easily do so, as the Cæsarian words are printed in the vocabularies in distinctive type. Concrete nouns have been preferred to abstract, root words to compounds and derivatives, even when the latter were of more frequent occurrence in Cæsar. To assist the memory, related English words are added in each special vocabulary. To insure more careful preparation, the special vocabularies have been removed from their respective lessons and placed by themselves. The general vocabulary contains about twelve hundred words, and of these above eighty-five per cent are found in Cæsar.</p>
<p>The syntax has been limited to those essentials which recent investigations, such as those of Dr. Lee Byrne and his collaborators, have shown to belong properly to the work of the first year. The constructions are presented, as far as possible, from the standpoint of English, the English usage being given first and the Latin compared or contrasted with it. Special attention has been given to the constructions of participles, the gerund and gerundive, and the infinitive in indirect statements. Constructions having a logical connection are not separated but are treated together.</p>
<p>Exercises for translation occur throughout, those for translation into Latin being, as a rule, only half as long as those for translation into English. In Part III a few of the commoner idioms in Cæsar are introduced and the sentences are drawn mainly from that author. From first to last a consistent effort is made to instill a proper regard for Latin word order, the first principles of which are laid down early in the course.</p>
<p>vii Selections for reading are unusually abundant and are introduced from the earliest possible moment. These increase in number and length as the book progresses, and, for the most part, are made an integral part of the lessons instead of being massed at the end of the book. This arrangement insures a more constant and thorough drill in forms and vocabulary, promotes reading power, and affords a breathing spell between succeeding subjects. The material is drawn from historical and mythological sources, and the vocabulary employed includes but few words not already learned. The book closes with a continued story which recounts the chief incidents in the life of a Roman boy. The last chapters record his experiences in Cæsar’s army, and contain much information that will facilitate the interpretation of the Commentaries. The early emphasis placed on word order and sentence structure, the simplicity of the syntax, and the familiarity of the vocabulary, make the reading selections especially useful for work in sight translation.</p>
<p>Reviews are called for at frequent intervals, and to facilitate this branch of the work an Appendix of Reviews has been prepared, covering both the vocabulary and the grammar.</p>
<p>The illustrations are numerous, and will, it is hoped, do much to stimulate interest in the ancient world and to create true and lasting impressions of Roman life and times.</p>
<p>A consistent effort has been made to use simple language and clear explanation throughout.</p>
<p>As an aid to teachers using this book a “Teacher’s Manual” has been prepared, which contains, in addition to general suggestions, notes on each lesson.</p>
<p>The author wishes to express his gratitude to the numerous teachers who tested the advance pages in their classes, and, as a result of their experience, have given much valuable aid by criticism and suggestion. Particular acknowledgments are due to Miss A. Susan Jones of the Central High School, Grand Rapids, Michigan; to Miss Clara Allison of the High School at Hastings, Michigan; and to Miss Helen B. Muir and Mr. Orland O. Norris, teachers of Latin in this institution.</p>

<h5 id="what-is-latin">What is Latin?</h5>
<p>If you will look at the map of Italy on the opposite page, you will find near the middle of the peninsula and facing the west coast a district called Latium,1 and Rome its capital. The Latin language, meaning the language of Latium, was spoken by the ancient Romans and other inhabitants of Latium, and Latin was the name applied to it after the armies of Rome had carried the knowledge of her language far beyond its original boundaries. As the English of to-day is not quite the same as that spoken two or three hundred years ago, so Latin was not always the same at all times, but changed more or less in the course of centuries. The sort of Latin you are going to learn was in use about two thousand years ago. And that period has been selected because the language was then at its best and the greatest works of Roman literature were being produced. This period, because of its supreme excellence, is called the Golden Age of Roman letters.</p>
<p>1. Pronounce <em>Lā´shĭ-ŭm</em>.</p>
<p>The Spread of Latin. For some centuries after Rome was founded, the Romans were a feeble and insignificant people, their territory was limited to Latium, and their existence constantly threatened by warlike neighbors. But after the third century before Christ, Rome’s power grew rapidly. She conquered all Italy, then reached out for the lands across the sea and beyond the Alps, and finally ruled over the whole ancient world. The empire thus established lasted for more than four 2 hundred years. The importance of Latin increased with the growth of Roman power, and what had been a dialect spoken by a single tribe became the universal language. Gradually the language changed somewhat, developing differently in different countries. In Italy it has become Italian, in Spain Spanish, and in France French. All these nations, therefore, are speaking a modernized form of Latin.</p>
<p>The Romans and the Greeks.In their career of conquest the Romans came into conflict with the Greeks. The Greeks were inferior to the Romans in military power, but far superior to them in culture. They excelled in art, literature, music, science, and philosophy. Of all these pursuits the Romans were ignorant until contact with Greece revealed to them the value of education and filled them with the thirst for knowledge. And so it came about that while Rome conquered Greece by force of arms, Greece conquered Rome by force of her intellectual superiority and became her schoolmaster. It was soon the established custom for young Romans to go to Athens and to other centers of Greek learning to finish their training, and the knowledge of the Greek language among the educated classes became universal. At the same time many cultured Greeks—poets, artists, orators, and philosophers—flocked to Rome, opened schools, and taught their arts. Indeed, the preëminence of Greek culture became so great that Rome almost lost her ambition to be original, and her writers vied with each other in their efforts to reproduce in Latin what was choicest in Greek literature. As a consequence of all this, the civilization and national life of Rome became largely Grecian, and to Greece she owed her literature and her art.</p>
<p>Rome and the Modern World.After conquering the world, Rome impressed her language, laws, customs of living, and modes of thinking upon the subject nations, and they became Roman; and the world has remained largely Roman ever since. Latin continued to live, and the knowledge of Latin was the only light of learning that burned steadily through the dark ages that followed the downfall of the Roman Empire. Latin was the common language of scholars and remained so even down to the days of Shakespeare. Even yet it is 3 more nearly than any other tongue the universal language of the learned. The life of to-day is much nearer the life of ancient Rome than the lapse of centuries would lead one to suppose. You and I are Romans still in many ways, and if Cæsar and Cicero should appear among us, we should not find them, except for dress and language, much unlike men of to-day.</p>
<p>Latin and English.Do you know that more than half of the words in the English dictionary are Latin, and that you are speaking more or less Latin every day? How has this come about? In the year 1066 William the Conqueror invaded England with an army of Normans. The Normans spoke French—which, you remember, is descended from Latin—and spread their language to a considerable extent over England, and so Norman-French played an important part in the formation of English and forms a large proportion of our vocabulary. Furthermore, great numbers of almost pure Latin words have been brought into English through the writings of scholars, and every new scientific discovery is marked by the addition of new terms of Latin derivation. Hence, while the simpler and commoner words of our mother tongue are Anglo-Saxon, and Anglo-Saxon forms the staple of our colloquial language, yet in the realms of literature, and especially in poetry, words of Latin derivation are very abundant. Also in the learned professions, as in law, medicine, and engineering, a knowledge of Latin is necessary for the successful interpretation of technical and scientific terms.</p>
<h5 id="why-study-latin">Why study Latin?</h5>
<p>The foregoing paragraphs make it clear why Latin forms so important a part of modern education. We have seen that our civilization rests upon that of Greece and Rome, and that we must look to the past if we would understand the present. It is obvious, too, that the knowledge of Latin not only leads to a more exact and effective use of our own language, but that it is of vital importance and of great practical value to any one preparing for a literary or professional career. To this it may be added that the study of Latin throws a flood of light upon the structure of language in general and lays an excellent foundation for all grammatical study. 4 Finally, it has been abundantly proved that there is no more effective means of strengthening the mind than by the earnest pursuit of this branch of learning.</p>
<ul>
<li>Review Questions. </li>
</ul>
<p>Whence does Latin get its name? Where is Latium? Where is Rome? Was Latin always the same? What sort of Latin are we to study? Describe the growth of Rome’s power and the spread of Latin. What can you say of the origin of Italian, French, and Spanish? How did the ancient Greeks and Romans compare? How did Greece influence Rome? How did Rome influence the world? In what sense are we Romans still? What did Latin have to do with the formation of English? What proportion of English words are of Latin origin, and what kind of words are they? Why should we study Latin?</p>

<h4 id="the-pronunciation-of-latin">THE PRONUNCIATION OF LATIN</h4>
<pre><code>THE ALPHABET

1. The Latin alphabet contains the same letters as the English except that it has no _w_ and no _j_.

2. The vowels, as in English, are _a, e, i, o, u, y_. The other letters are consonants.

3. _I_ is used both as a vowel and as a consonant. Before a vowel in the same syllable it has the value of a consonant and is called _I consonant_.

Thus in Iū-li-us the first _i_ is a consonant, the second a vowel.</code></pre><h5 id="sounds-of-the-letters">SOUNDS OF THE LETTERS</h5>
<p>1. N.B. The sounds of the letters are best learned by hearing them correctly pronounced. The matter in this section is, therefore, intended for reference rather than for assignment as a lesson. As a first step it is suggested that the teacher pronounce the examples in class, the pupils following.</p>
<p>4. Latin was not pronounced like English. The Romans at the beginning of the Christian era pronounced their language substantially as described below.</p>
<p>5. The vowels have the following sounds:</p>
<p>Vowels2</p>
<p>Latin Examples</p>
<p>ā as in <em>father</em></p>
<p>ă like the first <em>a</em> in <em>aha´</em>, never as in <em>hat</em></p>
<p>hāc, stās<br>ă´-măt, că-nās</p>
<p>ē as in <em>they</em><br>ĕ as in <em>met</em></p>
<p>tē´-lă, mē´-tă<br>tĕ´-nĕt, mĕr´-cēs</p>
<p>ī as in <em>machine</em><br>6 ĭ as in <em>bit</em></p>
<p>sĕr´-tī, prā´-tī<br>sĭ´-tĭs, bĭ´-bī</p>
<p>ō as in <em>holy</em><br>ŏ as in <em>wholly</em>, never as in <em>hot</em></p>
<p>Rō´-mă, ō´-rĭs<br>mŏ´-dŏ, bŏ´-nōs</p>
<p>ū as in <em>rude</em>, or as <em>oo</em> in <em>boot</em></p>
<p>ŭ as in <em>full</em>, or as <em>oo</em> in <em>foot</em></p>
<p>ū´-mŏr, tū´-bĕr<br>ŭt, tū´-tŭs</p>
<p>2. Long vowels are marked ¯, short ones ˘.</p>
<p>Note. It is to be observed that there is a decided difference in sound, except in the case of <em>a</em>, between the long and the short vowels. It is not merely a matter of <em>quantity</em> but also of <em>quality</em>.</p>
<p>6. In diphthongs(two-vowel sounds) both vowels are heard in a single syllable.</p>
<p>Diphthongs</p>
<p>Latin Examples</p>
<p>ae. as <em>ai</em> in <em>aisle</em><br>au. as <em>ou</em> in <em>out</em></p>
<p>tae´-dae<br>gau´-dĕt</p>
<p>ei. as <em>ei</em> in <em>eight</em></p>
<p>eu. as <em>ĕ´o͝o</em> (a short <em>e</em> followed by a short <em>u</em> in one syllable)</p>
<p>dein´-dĕ<br>seu</p>
<p>oe. like <em>oi</em> in <em>toil</em></p>
<p>ui. like <em>o͝o´ĭ</em> (a short <em>u</em> followed by a short <em>i</em> in one syllable. Cf. English <em>we</em>)</p>
<p>foe´-dŭs<br>cui, huic</p>
<p>Note. Give all the vowels and diphthongs their proper sounds and do not slur over them in unaccented syllables, as is done in English.</p>
<p>Consonants are pronounced as in English, except that</p>
<p>Consonants</p>
<p>Latin Examples</p>
<p>c. is always like <em>c</em> in <em>cat</em>, never as in <em>cent</em></p>
<p>g. is always like <em>g</em> in <em>get</em>, never as in <em>gem</em></p>
<ul>
<li>i consonantis always like <em>y</em> in <em>yes</em></li>
</ul>
<p>n. before <em>c, qu</em>, or <em>g</em> is like <em>ng</em> in <em>sing</em> (compare the sound of <em>n</em> in <em>anchor</em>)</p>
<p>că´-dō, cĭ´-bŭs, cē´-nă<br>gĕ´-mō, gĭg´-nō<br>iăm, iŏ´-cŭs<br>ăn´-cŏ-ră (ang´-ko-ra)</p>
<p>qu., gu, and sometimes subefore a vowel have the sound of <em>qw, gw</em>, and <em>sw</em>. Here <em>u</em> has the value of consonant <em>v</em> and is not counted a vowel</p>
<p>ĭn´-quĭt, quī, lĭn´-guă, săn´-guĭs, suā´-dĕ-ō</p>
<p>s. is like <em>s</em> in <em>sea</em>, never as in <em>ease</em></p>
<p>t. is always like <em>t</em> in <em>native</em>, never as in <em>nation</em></p>
<p>rŏ´-să, ĭs<br>ră´-tĭ-ō, nā´-tĭ-ō</p>
<p>v. is like <em>w</em> in <em>wine</em>, never as in <em>vine</em></p>
<p>x. has the value of two consonants (<em>cs</em> or <em>gs</em>) and is like <em>x</em> in <em>extract</em>, not as in <em>exact</em></p>
<p>vī´-nŭm, vĭr<br>ĕx´-trā, ĕx-āc´-tŭs</p>
<p>bs. is like <em>ps</em> and btlike <em>pt</em></p>
<p>ch., ph, and thare like <em>c</em>, <em>p</em>, <em>t</em></p>
<p>ŭrbs, ŏb-tĭ´-nĕ-ō  </p>
<p>pŭl´-chĕr, Phoe´-bē, thĕ-ā´-trŭm</p>
<p><em>a.</em> In combinations of consonants give each its distinct sound. Doubled consonants should be pronounced with a slight pause between the two sounds. Thus pronounce <em>tt</em> as in <em>rat-trap</em>, not as in <em>rattle</em>; <em>pp</em> as in <em>hop-pole</em>, not as in <em>upper</em>. Examples, mĭt´-tō, Ăp´pĭ-ŭs, bĕl´-lŭm.</p>
<h5 id="syllables">SYLLABLES</h5>
<p>8. A Latin word has as many syllables as it has vowels and diphthongs. Thus aes-tā´-tĕhas three syllables, au-dĭ-ĕn´-dŭshas four.</p>
<p><em>a.</em> Two vowels with a consonant between them never make one syllable, as is so often the case in English. Compare English <em>inside</em> with Latin īn-sī´-dĕ.</p>
<p>9. Words are divided into syllables as follows:</p>
<p>1. A single consonant between two vowels goes with the second. Thus ă-mā´-bĭ-lĭs, mĕ-mŏ´-rĭ-ă, ĭn-tĕ´-rĕ-ā, ă´-bĕst, pĕ-rē´-gĭt.3</p>
<p>3. In writing and printing it is customary to divide the parts of a compound, as inter-eā, ab-est, sub-āctus, per-ēgit, contrary to the correct phonetic rule.</p>
<p>2. Combinations of two or more consonants:</p>
<p><em>a.</em> A consonant followed by <em>l</em> or <em>r</em> goes with the <em>l</em> or <em>r</em>. Thus pū´-blĭ-cŭs, ă´-grī.</p>
<p>Exception. Prepositional compounds of this nature, as also <em>ll</em> and <em>rr</em>, follow rule <em>b</em>. Thus ăb´-lŭ-ō, ăb-rŭm´-pō, ĭl´-lĕ, fĕr´-rŭm.</p>
<p><em>b.</em> In all other combinations of consonants the first consonant goes with the preceding vowel.4 Thus măg´-nŭs, ĕ-gĕs´-tās, vĭc-tō´-rĭ-ă, hŏs´-pĕs, ăn´-nŭs, sŭ-bāc´-tŭs.</p>
<p>4. The combination nctis divided nc-t, as fūnc-tŭs, sānc-tŭs.</p>
<p>3. The last syllable of a word is called the <em>ul´-ti-ma</em>; the one next to the last, the <em>pe-nult´</em>; the one before the penult, the <em>an´-te-pe-nult´</em>.</p>
<p>8 10.EXERCISE</p>
<p>Divide the words in the following passage into syllables and pronounce them, placing the accent as indicated:</p>
<p>Vā́dĕ ăd fŏrmī́căm, Ō pĭ́gĕr, ĕt cōnsī́dĕrā vĭ́ās ĕ́iŭs ĕt dĭ́scĕ săpĭĕ́ntĭăm: quae cŭm nōn hắbĕăt dŭ́cĕm nĕc praecĕptṓrĕm nĕc prī́ncĭpĕm, pắrăt ĭn aestā́tĕ cĭ́bŭm sĭ́bĭ ĕt cŏ́ngrĕgăt ĭn mĕ́ssĕ quŏd cŏ́mĕdăt.</p>
<p>[Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise: which, having no guide, overseer, or ruler, provideth her meat in the summer and gathereth her food in the harvest.]</p>
<h5 id="quantity">QUANTITY</h5>
<p>11. The quantity of a vowel or a syllable is the time it takes to pronounce it. Correct pronunciation and accent depend upon the proper observance of quantity.</p>
<p>Quantity of Vowels.Vowels are either long (¯) or short (˘). In this book the long vowels are marked. Unmarked vowels are to be considered short.</p>
<p>1. A vowel is short before another vowel or <em>h</em>; as pŏ-ē´-ta, tră´-hō.</p>
<p>2. A vowel is short before <em>nt</em> and <em>nd</em>, before final <em>m</em> or <em>t</em>, and, except in words of one syllable, before final <em>l</em> or <em>r</em>. Thus a´-mănt, a-măn´-dus, a-mā´-băm, a-mā´-băt, a´-ni-măl, a´-mŏr.</p>
<p>3. A vowel is long before <em>nf</em>, <em>ns</em>, <em>nx</em>, and <em>nct</em>. Thus īn´-fe-rō, re´-gēns, sān´-xī, sānc´-tus.</p>
<p>4. Diphthongs are always long, and are not marked.</p>
<p>Quantity of Syllables.Syllables are either long or short, and their quantity must be carefully distinguished from that of vowels.</p>
<p>1. A syllable is short,</p>
<p><em>a.</em> If it ends in a short vowel; as ă´-mō, pĭ´-grĭ.</p>
<p>Note. In final syllables the short vowel may be followed by a final consonant. Thus the word mĕ-mŏ´-rĭ-ămcontains four short syllables. In the first three a short vowel ends the syllable, in the last the short vowel is followed by a final consonant.</p>
<p>9 2. A syllable is long,</p>
<p><em>a.</em> If it contains a long vowel or a diphthong, as cū´-rō, poe´-nae, aes-tā´-te.</p>
<p><em>b.</em> If it ends in a consonant which is followed by another consonant, as cor´-pus, mag´-nus.</p>
<p>Note. The vowel in a long syllable may be either long or short, and should be pronounced accordingly. Thus in ter´-ra, in´-ter, the first syllable is long, but the vowel in each case is short and should be given the short sound. In words like saxumthe first syllable is long because <em>x</em> has the value of two consonants (<em>cs</em> or <em>gs</em>).</p>
<p>3. In determining quantity <em>h</em> is not counted a consonant.</p>
<p>Note. Give about twice as much time to the long syllables as to the short ones. It takes about as long to pronounce a short vowel plus a consonant as it does to pronounce a long vowel or a diphthong, and so these quantities are considered equally long. For example, it takes about as long to say cŭr´-rōas it does cū´-rō, and so each of these first syllables is long. Compare mŏl´-lisand mō´-lis, ā-mĭs´-sīand ā-mi´-sī.</p>
<h5 id="accent">ACCENT</h5>
<p>14. Words of two syllables are accented on the first, as mēn´-sa, Cae´-sar.</p>
<p>15. Words of more than two syllables are accented on the penult if the penult is long. If the penult is short, accent the antepenult. Thus mo-nē´-mus, re´-gi-tur, a-gri´-co-la, a-man´-dus.</p>
<p>Note. Observe that the position of the accent is determined by the length of the <em>syllable</em> and not by the length of the vowel in the syllable. (Cf. <a href="#sec13">§ 13. 2</a>, Note.)</p>
<p>16. Certain little words called <em>enclit´ics_5 which have no separate existence, are added to and pronounced with a preceding word. The most common are -que, _and</em>; -ve, <em>or</em>; and -ne, the question sign. The syllable before an enclitic takes the accent, regardless of its quantity. Thus populus´que, dea´que, rēgna´ve, audit´ne.</p>
<p>5. Enclitic means <em>leaning back</em>, and that is, as you see, just what these little words do. They cannot stand alone and so they lean back for support upon the preceding word.</p>
<h5 id="how-to-read-latin">HOW TO READ LATIN</h5>
<p>17. To read Latin well is not so difficult, if you begin right. Correct habits of reading should be formed now. Notice the quantities carefully, especially the quantity of the penult, to insure your getting the accent on the right syllable. (Cf. <a href="#sec15">§ 15</a>.) Give every vowel its proper sound and every syllable its proper length. Then bear in mind that we should read Latin as we read English, in phrases rather than in separate words. Group together words that are closely connected in thought. No good reader halts at the end of each word.</p>
<p>18. Read the stanzas of the following poem by Longfellow, one at a time, first the English and then the Latin version. The syllables inclosed in parentheses are to be slurred or omitted to secure smoothness of meter.</p>

<pre><code>The shades of night were falling fast,  
As through an Alpine village passed  
A youth, who bore, ’mid snow and ice,  
A banner with the strange device,

“Try not the Pass!” the old man said;  
“Dark lowers the tempest overhead,  
11 The roaring torrent is deep and wide!”  
And loud that clarion voice replied,

<pre><code>WORDS AND FORMS

    LESSON I

FIRST PRINCIPLES</code></pre><p>Subject and Predicate.1. Latin, like English, expresses thoughts by means of sentences. A sentence is a combination of words that expresses a thought, and in its simplest form is the statement of a single fact. Thus,</p>
<p><em>Galba is a farmer</em>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Galba est agricola</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The sailor fights</em>  - Nauta pugnat</p>
<p>In each of these sentences there are two parts:</p>
<p>Subject</p>
<p><em>Galba</em>  - Galba </p>
<p><em>The sailor</em>  - Nauta</p>
<p>Predicate</p>
<p><em>is a farmer</em>  - est agricola </p>
<p><em>fights</em>  - pugnat</p>
<p>2. The subject is that person, place, or thing about which something is said, and is therefore a <em>noun</em> or some word which can serve the same purpose.</p>
<p><em>a.</em> Pronouns, as their name implies (<em>pro</em>, “instead of,” and <em>noun</em>), often take the place of nouns, usually to save repeating the same noun, as, <em>Galba is a farmer; heis a sturdy fellow</em>.</p>
<p>3. The predicate is that which is said about the subject, and consists of a verb with or without modifiers.</p>
<p><em>a.</em> A verb is a word which asserts something (usually an act) concerning a person, place, or thing.</p>
<p>13 20.</p>
<p>The Object.In the two sentences, <em>The boy hit the ball</em> and <em>The ball hit the boy</em>, the same words are used, but the meaning is different, and depends upon the order of the words. The doerof the act, that about which something is said, is, as we have seen above, the subject. That to which something is doneis the direct objectof the verb. <em>The boy hit the ball</em> is therefore analyzed as follows:</p>
<p>Subject</p>
<p>Predicate</p>
<p><em>The boy</em></p>
<p><em>hit the ball</em><br>(verb) (direct object)</p>
<p><em>a.</em> A verb whose action passes over to the object directly, as in the sentence above, is called a transitive verb. A verb which does not admit of a direct object is called intransitive, as, <em>I walk, he comes</em>.</p>
<p>The Copula.The verb <em>to be</em> in its different forms—<em>are</em>, <em>is</em>, <em>was</em>, etc.—does not tell us anything about the subject; neither does it govern an object. It simply connects the subject with the word or words in the predicate that possess a distinct meaning. Hence it is called the copula, that is, <em>the joiner</em> or <em>link</em>.</p>
<p>22. In the following sentences pronounce the Latin and name the <em>nouns, verbs, subjects, objects, predicates, copulas</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>America est patria mea 
<em>America is fatherland my</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>Agricola fīliam amat 
<em>(The) farmer (his) daughter loves</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>Fīlia est Iūlia 
<em>(His) daughter is Julia</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>Iūlia et agricola sunt in īnsulā 
<em>Julia and (the) farmer are on (the) island</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>Iūlia aquam portat 
<em>Julia water carries</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>Rosam in comīs habet 
<em>(A) rose in (her) hair (she) has</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>Iūlia est puella pulchra 
<em>Julia is (a) girl pretty</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>Domina fīliam pulchram habet 
<em>(The) lady (a) daughter beautiful has</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>a.</em> The sentences above show that Latin does not express some words which are necessary in English. First of all, <em>Latin has no article theor a</em>; thus <em>agricola</em> may mean <em>the farmer, a farmer</em>, or simply <em>farmer</em>. Then, too, the personal pronouns, <em>I, you, he, she</em>, etc., and the possessive pronouns, <em>my, your, his, her</em>, etc., are not expressed if the meaning of the sentence is clear without them.</p>
<h5 id="lesson-ii">LESSON II</h5>
<h6 id="first-principles-continued">FIRST PRINCIPLES (<em>Continued</em>)</h6>
<p>Inflection. Words may change their forms to indicate some change in sense or use, as, <em>is, are; was, were; who, whose, whom; farmer, farmer’s; woman, women</em>. This is called inflection. The inflection of a noun, adjective, or pronoun is called its declension, that of a verb its conjugation.</p>
<p>Number. Latin, like English, has two numbers, singular and plural. In English we usually form the plural by adding <em>-s</em> or <em>-es</em> to the singular. So Latin changes the singular to the plural by changing the ending of the word. Compare</p>
<ul>
<li>Naut-a pugnat 
<em>The sailor fights</em></li>
<li>Naut-ae pugnant 
<em>The sailors fight</em></li>
</ul>
<p>25. Rule. <em>Nouns that end in -ain the singular end in -aein the plural</em>.</p>
<p>26. Learn the following nouns so that you can give the English for the Latin or the Latin for the English. Write the plural of each.</p>
<ul>
<li>agri´cola, <em>farmer</em> (agriculture)1<br>aqua., <em>water</em> (aquarium)<br>causa., <em>cause, reason</em></li>
<li>do´mina, <em>lady of the house, mistress</em> (dominate)</li>
</ul>
<p>filia., <em>daughter</em> (filial)  - fortū´na, <em>fortune</em></p>
<p>fuga., <em>flight</em> (fugitive)  - iniū´ria, <em>wrong, injury</em>  - lūna, <em>moon</em> (lunar)<br>nauta., <em>sailor</em> (nautical)  - puel´la, <em>girl</em><br>silva., forest (silvan)<br>terra., <em>land</em> (terrace)</p>
<p>1. The words in parentheses are English words related to the Latin. When the words are practically identical, as causa, <em>cause</em>, no comparison is needed.</p>
<p>27. Compare again the sentences</p>
<ul>
<li>Nauta pugna-t 
<em>The sailor fights</em></li>
<li>Nautae pugna-nt 
<em>The sailors fight</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In the first sentence the verb pugna-tis in the third person singular, in the second sentence pugna-ntis in the third person plural.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rule. Agreement of Verb.<em>A finite verb must always be in the same person and number as its subject.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>29. Rule. <em>In the conjugation of the Latin verb the third person singular active ends in -t, the third person plural in -nt. The endings which show the person and number of the verb are called personal endings.</em></p>
<p>30. Learn the following verbs and write the plural of each. The personal pronouns <em>he</em>, <em>she</em>, <em>it</em>, etc., which are necessary in the inflection of the English verb, are not needed in the Latin, because the personal endings take their place. Of course, if the verb’s subject is expressed we do not translate the personal ending by a pronoun; thus nauta pugnatis translated <em>the sailor fights</em>, not <em>the sailor he fights</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>ama-t</li>
</ul>
<p><em>he (she, it)</em></p>
<p><em>loves, is loving, does love</em> (amity, amiable)</p>
<ul>
<li>labō´ra-t</li>
</ul>
<p><em>labors, is laboring, does labor</em></p>
<ul>
<li>nūntia-t2</li>
</ul>
<p><em>announces, is announcing, does announce</em></p>
<ul>
<li>porta-t</li>
</ul>
<p><em>carries, is carrying, does carry</em> (porter)</p>
<ul>
<li>pugna-t</li>
</ul>
<p><em>fights, is fighting, does fight</em> (pugnacious)</p>

<p>Declension of Nouns.We learned above (<a href="#sec19">§§ 19</a>, <a href="#sec20">20</a>) the difference between the subject and object, and that in English they may be distinguished by the order of the words. Sometimes, however, the order is such that we are left in doubt. For example, the sentence <em>The lady her daughter loves</em> might mean either that the lady loves her daughter, or that the daughter loves the lady.</p>
<p>1. If the sentence were in Latin, no doubt could arise, because the subject and the object are distinguished, not by the order of the words, but by the endings of the words themselves. Compare the following sentences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Domina fīliam amat</li>
</ul>
<p>Fīliam domina amat</p>
<p>Amat fīliam domina</p>
<p>Domina amat fīliam</p>
<p>The lady loves her daughter</p>
<ul>
<li>Fīlia dominam amat</li>
</ul>
<p>Dominam fīlia amat</p>
<p>Amat dominam fīlia</p>
<p>Fīlia amat dominam</p>
<p>The daughter loves the lady</p>
<p><em>a.</em> Observe that in each case the subject of the sentence ends in -aand the object in -am. The <em>form</em> of the noun shows how it is used in the sentence, and the order of the words has no effect on the essential meaning.</p>
<p>2. As stated above (<a href="#sec23">§ 23</a>), this change of ending is called declension, and each different ending produces what is called a case. When we decline a noun, we give all its different cases, or changes of endings. In English we have three cases,—nominative, possessive, and objective; but, in nouns, the nominative and objective have the same form, and only the possessive case shows a change of ending, by adding <em>’s</em> or the apostrophe. The interrogative pronoun, however, has the fuller declension, <em>who?</em> <em>whose?</em> <em>whom?</em></p>
<p>17 33.The following table shows a comparison between English and Latin declension forms, and should be thoroughly memorized:</p>

<p>35. We learned from the table (<a href="#sec33">§ 33</a>) that the Latin nominative, genitive, and accusative correspond, in general, to the nominative, possessive, and objective in English, and that they are used in the same way. This will be made even clearer by the following sentence:</p>

<h6 id="first-principles-continued-3">FIRST PRINCIPLES (<em>Continued</em>)</h6>
<p>The Dative Case.In addition to the relationships between words expressed by the nominative, genitive (possessive), and accusative (objective) cases, there are other relationships, to express which in English we use such words as <em>from</em>, <em>with</em>, <em>by</em>, <em>to</em>, <em>for</em>, <em>in</em>, <em>at</em>.1</p>
<p>1. Words like <em>to</em>, <em>for</em>, <em>by</em>, <em>from</em>, <em>in</em>, etc., which define the relationship between words, are called prepositions.</p>
<p>Latin, too, makes frequent use of such prepositions; but often it expresses these relations without them by means of case forms which 20 English does not possess. One of the cases found in the Latin declension and lacking in English is called the <em>dative</em>.</p>
<p>42. When the nominative singular ends in -a, the dative singular ends in -aeand the dative plural in -īs.</p>
<p>Note. Observe that the <em>genitive singular</em>, the <em>dative singular</em>, and the <em>nominative plural</em> all have the same ending, -ae; but the uses of the three cases are entirely different. The general meaning of the sentence usually makes clear which case is intended.</p>
<p><em>a.</em> Form the dative singular and plural of the following nouns: fuga, causa, fortūna, terra, aqua, puella, agricola, nauta, domina.</p>
<p>The Dative Relation.The dative case is used to express the relations conveyed in English by the prepositions <em>to</em>, <em>towards</em>, <em>for</em>.</p>
<p>These prepositions are often used in English in expressions of motion, such as <em>She went to town</em>, <em>He ran towards the horse</em>, <em>Columbus sailed for America</em>. In such cases the dative is not used in Latin, as <em>motion through space</em> is foreign to the dative relation. But the dative is used to denote that <em>to</em> or <em>towards which</em> a benefit, injury, purpose, feeling, or quality is directed, or that <em>for which</em> something serves or exists.</p>
<p><em>a.</em> What dative relations do you discover in the following?</p>
<p>The teacher gave a prize to John because he replied so promptly to all her questions—a good example for the rest of us. It is a pleasure to us to hear him recite. Latin is easy for him, but it is very hard for me. Some are fitted for one thing and others for another.</p>
<p>The Indirect Object.Examine the sentence</p>
<ul>
<li>Nauta fugam nūntiat, <em>the sailor announces the flight</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Here the verb, nūntiat, governs the direct object, fugam, in the accusative case. If, however, we wish to mention the persons to whomthe sailor announces the flight, as, <em>The sailor announces the flight to the farmers</em>, the verb will have two objects:</p>
<p>1. Its direct object, <em>flight</em> (fugam)</p>
<p>2. Its indirect object, <em>farmers</em></p>
<p>According to the preceding section, <em>to the farmers</em> is a relation covered by the dative case, and we are prepared for the following rule:</p>
<p>21 45.Rule. Dative Indirect Object.<em>The indirect object of a verb is in the Dative.</em></p>
<p><em>a.</em> The indirect object usually stands before the direct object.</p>
<p>46. We may now complete the translation of the sentence <em>The sailor announces the flight to the farmers</em>, and we have</p>

<h6 id="first-principles-continued-4">FIRST PRINCIPLES (<em>Continued</em>)</h6>
<p>The Ablative Case.Another case, lacking in English but found in the fuller Latin declension, is the <em>ab´la-tive.</em></p>
<p>49. When the nominative singular ends in -a, the ablative singular ends in -āand the ablative plural in -īs.</p>
<p><em>a.</em> Observe that the final -ă of the nominative is short, while the final -ā of the ablative is long, as,</p>
<p><em>Nom.</em> fīliă</p>
<p><em>Abl.</em> fīliā</p>
<p><em>b.</em> Observe that the ablative plural is like the dative plural.</p>
<p><em>c.</em> Form the ablative singular and plural of the following nouns: fuga, causa, fortūna, terra, aqua, puella, agricola, nauta, domina.</p>
<p>The Ablative Relation.The ablative case is used to express the relations conveyed in English by the prepositions <em>from</em>, <em>with</em>, <em>by</em>, <em>at</em>, <em>in</em>. It denotes</p>
<p>1. That from which something is separated, from which it starts, or of which it is deprived—generally translated by <em>from</em>.</p>
<p>2. That with which something is associated or by means of which it is done—translated by <em>with</em> or <em>by</em>.</p>
<p>3. The place where or the time when something happens—translated by <em>in</em> or <em>at</em>.</p>
<p><em>a.</em> What ablative relations do you discover in the following?</p>
<p>In our class there are twenty boys and girls. Daily at eight o’clock they come from home with their books, and while they are at school they study Latin with great zeal. In a short time they will be able to read with ease the books written by the Romans. By patience and perseverance all things in this world can be overcome.</p>
<p>Prepositions. While, as stated above (<a href="#sec41">§ 41</a>), many relations expressed in English by prepositions are in Latin expressed by case forms, still prepositions are of frequent occurrence, but only with the accusative or ablative.</p>
<p>23 52.Rule. Object of a Preposition.<em>A noun governed by a preposition must be in the Accusative or Ablative case.</em></p>
<p>53. Prepositions denoting the ablative relations <em>from, with, in, on</em>, are naturally followed by the ablative case. Among these are</p>
<ul>
<li>ā1 or ab, <em>from, away from</em></li>
<li>dē, <em>from, down from</em></li>
<li>ē1 or ex, <em>from, out from, out of</em></li>
</ul>
<p>cum., <em>with</em></p>
<p>in., <em>in, on</em></p>
<p>1. āand ēare used only before words beginning with a consonant; aband exare used before either vowels or consonants.</p>
<p>1. <em>Translate into Latin, using prepositions.</em> In the water, on the land, down from the forest, with the fortune, out of the forests, from the victory, out of the waters, with the sailors, down from the moon.</p>
<p>Adjectives. Examine the sentence</p>
<ul>
<li>Puella parva bonam deam amat, <em>the little girl loves the good goddess</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In this sentence parva(<em>little</em>) and bonam(<em>good</em>) are not nouns, but are descriptive words expressing quality. Such words are called <em>adjectives</em>,2 and they are said to belong to the noun which they describe.</p>
<p>2. <em>Pick out the adjectives in the following:</em> “When I was a little boy, I remember that one cold winter’s morning I was accosted by a smiling man with an ax on his shoulder. ‘My pretty boy,’ said he, ‘has your father a grindstone?’ ‘Yes, sir,’ said I. ‘You are a fine little fellow,’ said he. ‘Will you let me grind my ax on it?’”</p>
<p>You can tell by its ending to which noun an adjective belongs. The ending of parvashows that it belongs to puella, and the ending of bonamthat it belongs to deam. Words that belong together are said to agree, and the belonging-together is called <em>agreement</em>. Observe that <em>the adjective and its noun agree in number and case</em>.</p>
<p>55. Examine the sentences</p>
<ul>
<li>Puella est parva, <em>the girl is little</em></li>
<li>Puella parva bonam deam amat, <em>the little girl loves the good goddess</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In the first sentence the adjective parvais separated from its noun by the verb and stands in the predicate. It is therefore called a <em>predicate adjective</em>. In the second sentence the adjectives parvaand 24 bonamare closely attached to the nouns puellaand deamrespectively, and are called <em>attributive adjectives.</em></p>
<p><em>a.</em> Pick out the attributive and the predicate adjectives in the following:</p>
<p>Do you think Latin is hard? Hard studies make strong brains. Lazy students dislike hard studies. We are not lazy.</p>

<p><em>a.</em> When a person is called or addressed, the case used is called the <em>voc´ative</em> (Latin <em>vocāre</em>, “to call”). <em>In form the vocative is regularly like the nominative</em>. In English the name of the person addressed usually stands first in the sentence. <em>The Latin vocative rarely stands first</em>. Point out five examples of the vocative in this dialogue.</p>
<p><em>b.</em> Observe that questions answered by <em>yes</em> or <em>no</em> in English are answered in Latin by repeating the verb. Thus, if you wished to answer in Latin the question <em>Is the sailor fighting?</em> Pugnatne nauta?you would say Pugnat, <em>he is fighting</em>, or Nōn pugnat, <em>he is not fighting.</em></p>

<h6 id="the-first-or-ā-declension">THE FIRST OR <em>Ā</em>-DECLENSION</h6>
<p>57. In the preceding lessons we have now gone over all the cases, singular and plural, of nouns whose nominative singular ends in -a. All Latin nouns whose nominative singular ends in -abelong to the First Declension. It is also called the <em>Ā</em>-Declension because of the prominent part which the vowel aplays in the formation of the cases. We have also learned what relations are expressed by each case. These results are summarized in the following table:</p>
<p>Case</p>
<p>Noun</p>
<p>Translation</p>
<p>Use and General Meaning of Each Case</p>
<p>Singular</p>
<p><em>Nom.</em></p>

<p><em>of the lady</em>, or <em>the lady’s</em></p>
<p>The possessor of something</p>
<p><em>Dat.</em></p>
<p>domin -ae</p>
<p><em>to</em> or <em>for the lady</em></p>
<p>Expressing the relation <em>to</em> or <em>for</em>, especially the indirect object</p>

<p>domin -īs</p>
<p><em>from, with, by, in, the ladies</em></p>
<p>The Base.That part of a word which remains unchanged in inflection and to which the terminations are added is called the base.</p>
<p>Thus, in the declension above, domin-is the base and -ais the termination of the nominative singular.</p>
<p>26 59.Write the declension of the following nouns, separating the base from the termination by a hyphen. Also give them orally.</p>
<ul>
<li>pugna, terra, lūna, ancil´la, corō´na, īn´sula, silva</li>
</ul>
<p>60.</p>
<p>Gender. In English, names of living beings are either masculine or feminine, and names of things without life are neuter. This is called natural gender. Yet in English there are some names of things to which we refer as if they were feminine; as, “Have you seen my yacht? <em>She</em> is a beauty.” And there are some names of living beings to which we refer as if they were neuter; as, “Is the baby here? No, the nurse has taken <em>it</em> home.” Some words, then, have a gender quite apart from sex or real gender, and this is called grammatical gender.</p>
<p>Latin, like English, has three genders. Names of males are usually masculine and of females feminine, but <em>names of things have grammatical gender and may be either masculine, feminine, or neuter</em>. Thus we have in Latin the three words, lapis, <em>a stone</em>; rūpēs, <em>a cliff</em>; and saxum, <em>a rock</em>. Lapisis <em>masculine</em>, rūpēs_feminine_, and saxum_neuter_. The gender can usually be determined by the ending of the word, and <em>must always be learned</em>, for without knowing the gender it is impossible to write correct Latin.</p>
<p>Gender of First-Declension Nouns.Nouns of the first declension are feminine unless they denote males. Thus silvais feminine, but nauta, <em>sailor</em>, and agricola, <em>farmer</em>, are masculine.</p>

<p>64. We have for some time now been using adjectives and nouns together and you have noticed an agreement between them in <em>case</em> and in <em>number</em> (<a href="#sec54">§ 54</a>).

<p>Latin Word Order.The order of words in English and in Latin sentences is not the same.</p>
<p>In English we arrange words in a fairly fixed order. Thus, in the sentence <em>My daughter is getting dinner for the farmers</em>, we cannot alter the order of the words without spoiling the sentence. We can, however, throw emphasis on different words by speaking them with more force. Try the effect of reading the sentence by putting special force on <em>my, daughter, dinner, farmers</em>.</p>
<p>In Latin, where the office of the word in the sentence is shown by its <em>ending</em> (cf. <a href="#sec32">§ 32. 1</a>), and not by its <em>position</em>, the order of words is more free, and position is used to secure the same effect that in English is secured by emphasis of voice. To a limited extent we can alter the order of words in English, too, for the same purpose. Compare the sentences</p>
<p><em>I saw a game of football at Chicago last November</em> (normal order)</p>
<p>_ Last NovemberI saw a game of football at Chicago_</p>
<p><em>At Chicago, last November, I saw a game of football</em></p>
<p>1. In a Latin sentence the most emphatic place is the <em>first</em>; next in importance is the <em>last</em>; the weakest point is the <em>middle</em>. Generally the <em>subject</em> is the most important word, and is placed <em>first</em>; usually the <em>verb</em> is the next in importance, and is placed <em>last</em>. The other words of the sentence stand between these two in the order of their importance. Hence the normal order of words—that is, where no unusual emphasis is expressed—is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>subject_—_modifiers of the subject_—_indirect object_—_direct object_—_adverb_—_verb</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Changes from the normal order are frequent, and are due to the desire for throwing emphasis upon some word or phrase. <em>Notice the order of the</em> 30 <em>Latin words when you are translating, and imitate it when you are turning English into Latin.</em></p>
<p>2. Possessive pronouns and modifying genitives normally stand after their nouns. When placed before their nouns they are emphatic, as fīlia mea, <em>my daughter</em>; mea fīlia, <em>mydaughter</em>; casa Galbae, <em>Galba’s cottage</em>; Galbae casa, <em>Galba’scottage</em>.</p>
<p>Notice the variety of emphasis produced by writing the following sentence in different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fīlia mea agricolīs cēnam parat(normal order)</li>
<li>Mea fīlia agricolīs parat cēnam(meaand cēnamemphatic)</li>
<li>Agricolīs fīlia mea cēnam parat(agricolīsemphatic)</li>
</ul>
<p>3. An adjective placed before its noun is more emphatic than when it follows. When great emphasis is desired, the adjective is separated from its noun by other words.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fīlia mea casam parvam nōn amat(parvamnot emphatic)</li>
<li>Fīlia mea parvam casam nōn amat(parvammore emphatic)</li>
<li>Parvam fīlia mea casam nōn amat(parvamvery emphatic)</li>
</ul>
<p>4. Interrogative words usually stand first, the same as in English.</p>
<p>5. The copula (as est, sunt) is of so little importance that it frequently does not stand last, but may be placed wherever it sounds well.</p>

<h6 id="the-second-or-o-declension">THE SECOND OR <em>O</em>-DECLENSION</h6>
<p>70. Latin nouns are divided into five declensions.</p>
<p>The declension to which a noun belongs is shown by the ending of the genitive singular. This should always be learned along with the nominative and the gender.</p>
<p>71. The nominative singular of nouns of the Second or <em>O</em>-Declension ends in -us, -er, -ir, or -um. The genitive singular ends in -ī.</p>
<p>Gender. Nouns in -umare neuter. The others are regularly masculine.</p>
<p>Declension of nouns in -<em>us</em> and -<em>um</em>.Masculines in -usand neuters in -umare declined as follows:</p>
<p>dominus. (base domin-), m., <em>master</em></p>

<p>1. Compare the declension of dominaand of dominus.</p>
<p><em>a.</em> Observe that the masculines and the neuters have the same terminations excepting in the nominative singular and the nominative and accusative plural.</p>
<p><em>b.</em> The vocative singular of words of the second declension in -usends in -ĕ, as domine, <em>O master</em>; serve, <em>O slave</em>. This is the most important exception to the rule in <a href="#sec56">§ 56. <em>a</em></a>.</p>
<p>74. Write side by side the declension of domina, dominus, and pīlum. A comparison of the forms will lead to the following rules, which are of great importance because they apply to all five declensions:</p>
<p><em>a.</em> The vocative, with a single exception (see <a href="#sec73">§ 73. <em>b</em></a>), is like the nominative. That is, the vocative singular is like the nominative singular, and the vocative plural is like the nominative plural.</p>
<p><em>b.</em> The nominative, accusative, and vocative of neuter nouns are alike, and in the plural end in -a.</p>
<p><em>c.</em> The accusative singular of masculines and feminines ends in -mand the accusative plural in -s.</p>
<p><em>d.</em> The dative and ablative plural are always alike.</p>
<p><em>e.</em> Final -iand -oare always <em>long</em>; final -ais <em>short</em>, except in the ablative singular of the first declension.</p>
<p>75. Observe the sentences</p>
<ul>
<li>Lesbia est bona, <em>Lesbia is good</em></li>
<li>Lesbia est ancilla, <em>Lesbia is a maidservant</em></li>
</ul>
<p>We have learned (<a href="#sec55">§ 55</a>) that bona, when used, as here, in the predicate to describe the subject, is called a <em>predicate adjective</em>. Similarly a <em>noun</em>, as ancilla, used in the <em>predicate</em> to define the subject is called a predicate noun.</p>
<p>76. Rule. Predicate Noun.<em>A predicate noun agrees in case with the subject of the verb.</em></p>

<p>84. Thus far the adjectives have had the same terminations as the nouns. However, the agreement between the adjective and its noun does <em>not</em> mean that they must have the same termination. If the adjective and the noun belong to different declensions, the terminations will, in many cases, not be the same. For example, nauta, <em>sailor</em>, is masculine and belongs to the first declension. The masculine form of the adjective bonusis of the second declension. Consequently, <em>a good sailor</em> is nauta bonus. So, <em>the wicked farmer</em> is agricola malus. Learn the following declensions:</p>

<h6 id="the-possessive-adjective-pronouns">THE POSSESSIVE ADJECTIVE PRONOUNS</h6>
<p>97. Observe the sentences</p>
<p><em>This is my shield</em></p>
<p><em>This shield is mine</em></p>
<p>In the first sentence <em>my</em> is a possessive adjective; in the second <em>mine</em> is a possessive pronoun, for it takes the place of a noun, <em>this shield is mine</em> being equivalent to <em>this shield is my shield</em>. Similarly, in Latin the possessives are sometimes <em>adjectives</em> and sometimes <em>pronouns</em>.</p>
<p>98. The possessives <em>my, mine, your, yours</em>, etc. are declined like adjectives of the first and second declensions.</p>
<p>Singular</p>
<p><em>1st Pers.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>meus, mea, meum</li>
</ul>
<p><em>my, mine</em></p>
<p><em>2d Pers.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>tuus, tua, tuum</li>
</ul>
<p><em>your, yours</em></p>
<p><em>3d Pers.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>suus, sua, suum</li>
</ul>
<p><em>his (own), her (own), its (own)</em></p>
<p>Plural</p>
<p><em>1st Pers.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>noster, nostra, nostrum</li>
</ul>
<p><em>our, ours</em></p>
<p><em>2d Pers.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>vester, vestra, vestrum</li>
</ul>
<p><em>your, yours</em></p>
<p><em>3d Pers.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>suus, sua, suum</li>
</ul>
<p><em>their (own), theirs</em></p>
<p>Note. Meushas the irregular vocative singular masculine mī, as mī fīlī, <em>O my son</em>.</p>
<p><em>a.</em> The possessives agree with the name of the <em>thing possessed</em> in gender, number, and case. Compare the English and Latin in</p>
<p><em>Sextus is calling hisboy</em></p>
<p><em>Julia is calling herboy</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Sextus</li>
</ul>
<p>Iūlia</p>
<p>suum puerum vocat</p>
<p>Observe that suumagrees with puerum, and is unaffected by the gender of Sextus or Julia.</p>
<p><em>b.</em> When <em>your, yours</em>, refers to <em>one</em> person, use tuus; when to <em>more than one</em>, vester; as,</p>
<p><em>Lesbia, your wreaths are pretty<br>Girls, your wreaths are pretty</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Corōnae tuae, Lesbia, sunt pulchrae<br>Corōnae vestrae, puellae, sunt pulchrae</li>
</ul>
<p>43 <em>c.</em> Suusis a <em>reflexive</em> possessive, that is, it usually stands in the predicate and regularly refers back to the <em>subject</em>. Thus, Vir suōs servōs vocatmeans <em>The man calls his (own) slaves.</em> Here <em>his</em> (suōs) refers to <em>man</em> (vir), and could not refer to any one else.</p>
<p><em>d.</em> Possessives are used much less frequently than in English, being omitted whenever the meaning is clear without them. (Cf. <a href="#sec22">§ 22</a>. a.) This is especially true of suus, -a, -um, which, when inserted, is more or less emphatic, like our <em>his own, her own</em>, etc.</p>

<h6 id="the-ablative-denoting-with">THE ABLATIVE DENOTING <em>WITH</em></h6>
<p>100. Of the various relations denoted by the ablative case (<a href="#sec50">§ 50</a>) there is none more important than that expressed in English by the preposition <em>with</em>. This little word is not so simple as it looks. It does not always convey the same meaning, nor is it always to be translated by cum. This will become clear from the following sentences:</p>
<p><em>a.</em> Mark is feeble <em>with</em> (<em>for</em> or <em>because of</em>) want of food</p>
<p><em>b.</em> Diana kills the beasts <em>with</em> (or <em>by</em>) her arrows</p>
<p><em>c.</em> Julia is <em>with</em> Sextus</p>
<p><em>d.</em> The men fight <em>with</em> great steadiness</p>
<p><em>a.</em> In sentence <em>a</em>, <em>with want</em> (<em>of food</em>) gives the cause of Mark’s feebleness. This idea is expressed in Latin by the ablative without a preposition, and the construction is called the ablative of cause:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mārcus est īnfīrmus inopiā cibī</li>
</ul>
<p><em>b.</em> In sentence <em>b</em>, <em>with</em> (or <em>by</em>) <em>her arrows</em> tells by means of whatDiana kills the beasts. This idea is expressed in Latin by the ablative without a preposition, and the construction is called the ablative of means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diāna sagittīs suīs ferās necat</li>
</ul>
<p><em>c.</em> In sentence <em>c</em> we are told that Julia is not alone, but in company withSextus. This idea is expressed in Latin by the ablative with the preposition cum, and the construction is called the ablative of accompaniment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Iūlia est cum Sextō</li>
</ul>
<p><em>d.</em> In sentence <em>d</em> we are told how the men fight. The idea is one of manner. This is expressed in Latin by the ablative with cum, unless there is a modifying adjective present, in which case cummay be omitted. This construction is called the ablative of manner:</p>
<ul>
<li>Virī (cum) cōnstantiā magnā pugnant</li>
</ul>
<ol start="101">
<li>You are now able to form four important rules for the ablative denoting <em>with</em>:</li>
</ol>
<p>45 102.Rule. Ablative of Cause.<em>Cause is denoted by the ablative without a preposition. This answers the question Because of what?</em></p>
<p>103. Rule. Ablative of Means.<em>Means is denoted by the ablative without a preposition. This answers the question By means of what? With what?</em></p>
<p>N.B. Cummust never be used with the ablative expressing cause or means.</p>
<p>104. Rule. Ablative of Accompaniment.<em>Accompaniment is denoted by the ablative with cum. This answers the question With whom?</em></p>
<p>105. Rule. Ablative of Manner.<em>The ablative with cumis used to denote the manner of an action. Cummay be omitted, if an adjective is used with the ablative. This answers the question How? In what manner?</em></p>
<p>106. What uses of the ablative do you discover in the following passage, and what question does each answer?</p>
<p>The soldiers marched to the fort with great speed and broke down the gate with blows of their muskets. The inhabitants, terrified by the din, attempted to cross the river with their wives and children, but the stream was swollen with (<em>or</em> by) the rain. Because of this many were swept away by the waters and only a few, almost overcome with fatigue, with great difficulty succeeded in gaining the farther shore.</p>

<h6 id="the-demonstrative-is-ea-id">THE DEMONSTRATIVE <em>IS, EA, ID</em></h6>
<p>112. A demonstrative is a word that points out an object definitely, as <em>this, that, these, those</em>. Sometimes these words are pronouns, as, <em>Do you hear these?</em> and sometimes adjectives, as, <em>Do you hear these men?</em> In the former case they are called demonstrative pronouns, in the latter demonstrative adjectives.</p>
<p>113. Demonstratives are similarly used in Latin both as <em>pronouns</em> and as <em>adjectives</em>. The one used most is</p>

<ol start="119">
<li>The inflection of a verb is called its <em>conjugation</em> (cf. <a href="#sec23">§ 23</a>). In English the verb has but few changes in form, the different meanings being expressed by the use of personal pronouns and auxiliaries, as, <em>I am carried, we have carried, they shall have carried</em>, etc. In Latin, on the other hand, instead of using personal pronouns and auxiliary verbs, the form changes with the meaning. In this way the Romans expressed differences in <em>tense, mood, voice, person</em>, and <em>number</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Tenses.The different forms of a verb referring to different times are called its <em>tenses</em>. The chief distinctions of time are present, past, and future:</p>
<p>1. The present, that is, <em>what is happening now</em>, or <em>what usually happens</em>, is expressed by</p>
<p>the Present Tense</p>
<p>2. The past, that is, <em>what was happening, used to happen, happened, has happened</em>, or <em>had happened</em>, is expressed by</p>
<p>the Imperfect, Perfect, and Pluperfect Tenses</p>
<p>3. The future, that is, <em>what is going to happen</em>, is expressed by</p>
<p>the Future and Future Perfect Tenses</p>
<p>The Moods.Verbs have inflection of <em>mood</em> to indicate the manner in which they express action. The moods of the Latin verb are the <em>indicative, subjunctive, imperative</em>, and <em>infinitive</em>.</p>
<p><em>a.</em> A verb is in the <em>indicative</em> mood when it makes a statement or asks a question about something assumed as a fact. All the verbs we have used thus far are in the present indicative.</p>
<p>The Persons.There are three persons, as in English. The first person is the person speaking (<em>I sing</em>); the second person the person spoken to (<em>you sing</em>); the third person the person spoken of 52 (<em>he sings</em>). Instead of using personal pronouns for the different persons in the two numbers, singular and plural, the Latin verb uses the personal endings (cf. <a href="#sec22">§ 22 <em>a</em></a>; <a href="#sec29">29</a>). We have already learned that -tis the ending of the third person singular in the active voice and -ntof the third person plural. The complete list of personal endings of the active voice is as follows:</p>
<p>Singular</p>
<p>Plural</p>
<p><em>1st Pers.</em></p>
<p><em>I</em></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<ol start="123">
<li>Most verbs form their moods and tenses after a regular plan and are called <em>regular</em> verbs. Verbs that depart from this plan are called <em>irregular</em>. The verb <em>to be</em> is irregular in Latin as in English. The present, imperfect, and future tenses of the indicative are inflected as follows:</li>

<h6 id="the-four-regular-conjugations-·-present-active-indicative-of-amō-and-moneō">THE FOUR REGULAR CONJUGATIONS · PRESENT ACTIVE INDICATIVE OF <em>AMŌ</em> AND <em>MONEŌ</em></h6>
<p>126. There are four conjugations of the regular verbs. These conjugations are distinguished from each other by the final vowel of the present conjugation-stem.1 This vowel is called the <em>distinguishing vowel</em>, and is best seen in the present infinitive.</p>
<p>1. The <em>stem</em> is the body of a word to which the terminations are attached. It is often identical with the base (cf. <a href="#sec58">§ 58</a>). If, however, the stem ends in a vowel, the latter does not appear in the base, but is variously combined with the inflectional terminations. This point is further explained in <a href="#sec230">§ 230</a>.</p>
<p>Below is given the <em>present infinitive</em> of a verb of each conjugation, the <em>present stem</em>, and the <em>distinguishing vowel.</em></p>

<p>55 1. The present tense is inflected by adding the personal endings to the present stem, and its first person uses -oand not -m. The form amōis for amā-ō, the two vowels ā-ōcontracting to ō. In moneōthere is no contraction. <em>Nearly all regular verbs ending in -eobelong to the second conjugation.</em></p>
<p>2. Note that the long final vowel of the stem is shortened before another vowel (monē-ō= mo´nĕō), and before final -t(amăt, monĕt) and -nt(amănt, monĕnt). Compare <a href="#sec12">§ 12. 2</a>.</p>

<p>Tense Signs.Instead of using auxiliary verbs to express differences in tense, like <em>was</em>, <em>shall</em>, <em>will</em>, etc., Latin adds to the verb stem certain elements that have the force of auxiliary verbs. These are called <em>tense signs</em>.</p>

<p>Note. Consult the general vocabulary for Apollō, inquit, duōs, and quattuordecim. Try to remember the meaning of all the other words.</p>
<p>1. Observe the force of the imperfect here, <em>used to prepare</em>, <em>were in the habit of preparing</em>; so amābantdenotes a past situation of affairs. (See <a href="#sec134">§ 134</a>.)</p>

<p>141. Review the present, imperfect, and future active indicative, both orally and in writing, of sumand the verbs in <a href="#sec129">§ 129</a>.</p>
<p>142. We learned in <a href="#sec43">§ 43</a> for what sort of expressions we may expect the dative, and in <a href="#sec44">§ 44</a> that one of its commonest uses is with <em>verbs</em> to express the indirect object. It is also very common with <em>adjectives</em> to express the object toward which the quality denoted by the adjective is directed. We have already had a number of cases 60 where grātus, <em>agreeable to</em>, was so followed by a dative; and in the last lesson we had molestus, <em>annoying to</em>, followed by that case. The usage may be more explicitly stated by the following rule:</p>
<p>143. Rule. Dative with Adjectives.<em>The dative is used with adjectives to denote the object toward which the given quality is directed. Such are, especially, those meaning near, also fit, friendly, pleasing, like, and their opposites.</em></p>
<p>144. Among such adjectives memorize the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>idōneus, -a, -um, <em>fit, suitable</em> (for)</li>
<li>amīcus, -a, -um, <em>friendly</em> (to)</li>
<li>inimicus, -a, -um, <em>hostile</em> (to)</li>
<li>grātus, -a, -um, <em>pleasing</em> (to), <em>agreeable</em> (to)</li>
<li>molestus, -a, -um, <em>annoying</em> (to), <em>troublesome</em> (to)</li>

<p>3. re´gunt, <em>they rule</em></p>
<p>au´diunt, <em>they hear</em></p>
<p>1. The personal endings are the same as before.</p>
<p>2. The final short -e-of the stem regĕ-combines with the -ōin the first person, becomes -u-in the third person plural, and becomes -ĭ-elsewhere. The inflection is like that of erō, the future of sum.</p>
<p>62 3. In audiōthe personal endings are added regularly to the stem audī-. In the third person plural -u-is inserted between the stem and the personal ending, as audi-u-nt. Note that the long vowel of the stem is shortened before final -tjust as in amōand moneō. (Cf. <a href="#sec12">§ 12. 2</a>.)</p>
<p>Note that -i-is always short in the third conjugation and long in the fourth, excepting where long vowels are regularly shortened. (Cf. <a href="#sec12">§ 12. 1, 2</a>.)</p>

<p>The Dative with Special Intransitive Verbs.We learned above (<a href="#sec20">§ 20. <em>a</em></a>) that a verb which does not admit of a direct object is called an <em>intransitive</em> verb. Many such verbs, however, are of such meaning that they can govern an indirect object, which will, of course, be in the dative case (<a href="#sec45">§ 45</a>). Learn the following list of intransitive verbs with their meanings. In each case the dative indirect object is the person or thing to which a benefit, injury, or feeling is directed. (Cf. <a href="#sec43">§ 43</a>.)</p>
<ul>
<li>crēdō, crēdere, <em>believe</em> (give belief to)</li>
<li>faveō, favēre, <em>favor</em> (show favor to)</li>
<li>noceō, nocēre, <em>injure</em> (do harm to)</li>
<li>pāreō, pārēre, <em>obey</em> (give obedience to)</li>
<li>persuādeō, persuādēre, <em>persuade</em> (offer persuasion to)</li>
<li>resistō, resistere, <em>resist</em> (offer resistance to)</li>
<li>studeō, studēre, <em>be eager for</em> (give attention to)</li>

<p>The Voices.Thus far the verb forms have been in the <em>active voice</em>; that is, they have represented the subject as <em>performing</em> an action; as,</p>
<p>The lion——&gt; _killed_——&gt; the hunter</p>
<p>A verb is said to be in the <em>passive voice</em> when it represents its subject as <em>receiving</em> an action; as,</p>
