The Latin language, meaning the language of Latium, was spoken by the ancient Romans and other inhabitants of Latium, and Latin was the name applied to it after the armies of Rome had carried the knowledge of her language far beyond its original boundaries. As the English of to-day is not quite the same as that spoken two or three hundred years ago, so Latin was not always the same at all times, but changed more or less in the course of centuries. The sort of Latin you are going to learn was in use about two thousand years ago. And that period has been selected because the language was then at its best and the greatest works of</p>",

For some centuries after Rome was founded, the Romans were a feeble and insignificant people, their territory was limited to Latium, and their existence constantly threatened by warlike neighbors. But after the third century before Christ, Rome’s power grew rapidly. She conquered all Italy, then reached out for the lands across the sea and beyond the Alps, and finally ruled over the whole ancient world. The empire thus established lasted for more than four 2 hundred years. The importance of Latin increased with the growth of Roman power, and what had been a dialect spoken by a single tribe became the universal language. Gradually the language changed somewhat, developing differently in different countries.</p>",

All these nations, therefore, are speaking a modernized form of Latin.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The Romans and the Greeks.In their career of conquest the Romans came into conflict with the Greeks. The Greeks were inferior to the Romans in military power, but far superior to them in culture. They excelled in art, literature, music, science, and philosophy. Of all these pursuits the Romans were ignorant until contact with Greece revealed to them the value of education and filled them with the thirst for knowledge. And so it came about that while Rome conquered Greece by force of arms, Greece conquered Rome by force of her intellectual superiority and became her schoolmaster. It was soon the established custom for young Romans to go to Athens and to other centers of Greek learning to finish their training, and the knowledge of the Greek language among the</p>",
  "page-24": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">educated classes became universal. At the same time many cultured Greeks—poets, artists, orators, and philosophers—flocked to Rome, opened schools, and taught their arts. Indeed, the preëminence of Greek culture became so great that Rome almost lost her ambition to be original, and her writers vied with each other in their efforts to reproduce in Latin what was choicest in Greek literature. As a consequence of all this, the civilization and national life of Rome became largely Grecian, and to Greece she owed her literature and her art.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Rome and the Modern World.After conquering the world, Rome impressed her language, laws, customs of living, and modes of thinking upon the subject nations, and they became Roman; and the world has remained largely Roman ever since.

Hence, while the simpler and commoner words of our mother tongue are Anglo-Saxon, and Anglo-Saxon forms the staple of our colloquial language, yet in the realms of literature, and especially in poetry, words of Latin derivation are very abundant.

To this it may be added that the study of Latin throws a flood of light upon the structure of language in general and lays an excellent foundation for all grammatical study. 4 Finally, it has been abundantly proved that there is no more effective means of strengthening the mind than by the earnest pursuit of this branch of learning.</p><ul><li>Review Questions.</li></ul><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Whence does Latin get its name?

  "page-50": "<pre><code>WORDS AND FORMS\n\n    LESSON I\n\nFIRST PRINCIPLES</code></pre><p>Subject and Predicate.1. Latin, like English, expresses thoughts by means of sentences. A sentence is a combination of words that expresses a thought, and in its simplest form is the statement of a single fact. Thus,</p><p><em>Galba is a farmer</em></p><blockquote><p>Galba est agricola</p></blockquote><p><em>The sailor fights</em>  - Nauta pugnat</p><p>In each of these sentences there are two parts:</p><p>Subject</p><p><em>Galba</em>  - Galba</p>",
  "page-51": "<p><em>The sailor</em>  - Nauta</p><p>Predicate</p><p><em>is a farmer</em>  - est agricola</p><p><em>fights</em>  - pugnat</p><p>2. The subject is that person, place, or thing about which something is said, and is therefore a <em>noun</em> or some word which can serve the same purpose.</p><p><em>a.</em> Pronouns, as their name implies (<em>pro</em>, “instead of,” and <em>noun</em>), often take the place of nouns, usually to save repeating the same noun, as, <em>Galba is a farmer; heis a sturdy fellow</em>.</p><p>3. The predicate is that which is said about the subject, and consists of a verb with or without modifiers.</p><p><em>a.</em> A verb is a word which asserts something (usually an act) concerning a person, place, or thing.</p><p>13 20.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The Object.In the two sentences, <em>The boy hit the ball</em></p>",
  "page-52": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">and <em>The ball hit the boy</em>, the same words are used, but the meaning is different, and depends upon the order of the words. The doerof the act, that about which something is said, is, as we have seen above, the subject. That to which something is doneis the direct objectof the verb. <em>The boy hit the ball</em> is therefore analyzed as follows:</p><p>Subject</p><p>Predicate</p><p><em>The boy</em></p><p><em>hit the ball</em><br>(verb) (direct object)</p><p><em>a.</em> A verb whose action passes over to the object directly, as in the sentence above, is called a transitive verb. A verb which does not admit of a direct object is called intransitive, as, <em>I walk, he comes</em>.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The Copula.The verb <em>to be</em> in its different forms—<em>are</em>, <em>is</em>, <em>was</em>, etc.—does not tell us anything about the</p>",
  "page-53": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">subject; neither does it govern an object. It simply connects the subject with the word or words in the predicate that possess a distinct meaning. Hence it is called the copula, that is, <em>the joiner</em> or <em>link</em>.</p><p>22. In the following sentences pronounce the Latin and name the <em>nouns, verbs, subjects, objects, predicates, copulas</em>:</p><ol><li>America est patria mea \nAmerica is fatherland my</li><li>Agricola fīliam amat \n(The) farmer (his) daughter loves</li><li>Fīlia est Iūlia \n(His) daughter is Julia</li><li>Iūlia et agricola sunt in īnsulā \nJulia and (the) farmer are on (the) island</li><li>Iūlia aquam portat \nJulia water carries</li><li>Rosam in comīs habet \n(A) rose in (her) hair (she) has</li></ol>",

First of all, <em>Latin has no article theor a</em>; thus <em>agricola</em> may mean <em>the farmer, a farmer</em>, or simply <em>farmer</em>. Then, too, the personal pronouns, <em>I, you, he, she</em>, etc., and the possessive pronouns, <em>my, your, his, her</em>, etc., are not expressed if the meaning of the sentence is clear without them.</p><h5>Lesson Ii</h5><h6>First Principles (<Em>continued</em>)</h6><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Inflection.

  "page-55": "<p class=\"no-indent  \"><em>women</em>. This is called inflection. The inflection of a noun, adjective, or pronoun is called its declension, that of a verb its conjugation.</p><p>Number. Latin, like English, has two numbers, singular and plural. In English we usually form the plural by adding <em>-s</em> or <em>-es</em> to the singular. So Latin changes the singular to the plural by changing the ending of the word.

The personal pronouns <em>he</em>, <em>she</em>, <em>it</em>, etc., which are necessary in the inflection of the English verb, are not needed in the Latin, because the personal endings take their place.

  "page-211": "<h6>Conjugation</h6><h6>The Present, Imperfect, And Future Tenses Of Sum</h6><ol><li>The inflection of a verb is called its conjugation (cf. § 23). In English the verb has but few changes in form, the different meanings being expressed by the use of personal pronouns and auxiliaries, as, I am carried, we have carried, they shall have carried, etc. In Latin, on the other hand, instead of using personal pronouns and auxiliary verbs, the form changes with the meaning. In this way the Romans expressed differences in tense, mood, voice, person, and number.</li></ol><p>The Tenses.The different forms of a verb referring to different times are called its <em>tenses</em>. The chief distinctions of time are present, past, and future:</p>",

The future, that is, <em>what is going to happen</em>, is expressed by</p><p>the Future and Future Perfect Tenses</p><p>The Moods.Verbs have inflection of <em>mood</em> to indicate the manner in which they express action. The moods of the Latin verb are the <em>indicative, subjunctive, imperative</em>, and <em>infinitive</em>.</p><p><em>a.</em> A verb is in the <em>indicative</em> mood when it makes a statement or asks a question about something assumed as a fact.

  "page-213": "<p>The Persons.There are three persons, as in English. The first person is the person speaking (<em>I sing</em>); the second person the person spoken to (<em>you sing</em>); the third person the person spoken of 52 (<em>he sings</em>). Instead of using personal pronouns for the different persons in the two numbers, singular and plural, the Latin verb uses the personal endings (cf. <a href=\"#sec22\">§ 22 <em>a</em></a>; <a href=\"#sec29\">29</a>). We have already learned that -tis the ending of the third person singular in the active voice and -ntof the third person plural.
