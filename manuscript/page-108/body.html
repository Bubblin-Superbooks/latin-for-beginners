Thus, in the sentence <em>My daughter is getting dinner for the farmers</em>, we cannot alter the order of the words without spoiling the sentence. We can, however, throw emphasis on different words by speaking them with more force.

To a limited extent we can alter the order of words in English, too, for the same purpose.
