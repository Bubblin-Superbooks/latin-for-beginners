Sometimes, however, the order is such that we are left in doubt. For example, the sentence <em>The lady her daughter loves</em> might mean either that the lady loves her daughter, or that the daughter loves the lady.</p><p>1. If the sentence were in Latin, no doubt could arise, because the subject and the object are distinguished, not by the order of the words, but by the endings of the words themselves. Compare the following sentences:</p><ul><li>Domina fīliam amat</li></ul></div> </div>
