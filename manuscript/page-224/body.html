There are four conjugations of the regular verbs. These conjugations are distinguished from each other by the final vowel of the present conjugation-stem.1 This vowel is called the <em>distinguishing vowel</em>, and is best seen in the present infinitive.</p><p>1. The <em>stem</em> is the body of a word to which the terminations are attached. It is often identical with the base (cf. <a href="#sec58">§ 58</a>). If, however, the stem ends in a vowel, the latter does not appear in the base, but is variously combined with the inflectional terminations. This point is further explained in <a href="#sec230">§ 230</a>.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Below is given the <em>present infinitive</em> of a verb of each</p></div> </div>
