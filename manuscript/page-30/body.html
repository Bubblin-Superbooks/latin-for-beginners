1. The Latin alphabet contains the same letters as the English except that it has no _w_ and no _j_.

2. The vowels, as in English, are _a, e, i, o, u, y_. The other letters are consonants.

3. _I_ is used both as a vowel and as a consonant. Before a vowel in the same syllable it has the value of a consonant and is called _I consonant_.

Thus in IÅ«-li-us the first _i_ is a consonant, the second a vowel.</code></pre><h5>Sounds Of The Letters</h5></div> </div>
