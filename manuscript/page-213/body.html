<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>The Persons.There are three persons, as in English. The first person is the person speaking (<em>I sing</em>); the second person the person spoken to (<em>you sing</em>); the third person the person spoken of 52 (<em>he sings</em>). Instead of using personal pronouns for the different persons in the two numbers, singular and plural, the Latin verb uses the personal endings (cf. <a href="#sec22">ยง 22 <em>a</em></a>; <a href="#sec29">29</a>). We have already learned that -tis the ending of the third person singular in the active voice and -ntof the third person plural. The complete list of personal endings of the active voice is as follows:</p><p>Singular</p><p>Plural</p><p><em>1st Pers.</em></p><p><em>I</em></p><ul><li>-mor -ล</li></ul><p><em>we</em></p><ul><li>-mus</li></ul></div> </div>
