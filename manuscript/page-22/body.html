For some centuries after Rome was founded, the Romans were a feeble and insignificant people, their territory was limited to Latium, and their existence constantly threatened by warlike neighbors.

She conquered all Italy, then reached out for the lands across the sea and beyond the Alps, and finally ruled over the whole ancient world.
