</p></blockquote><p>29. Rule. <em>In the conjugation of the Latin verb the third person singular active ends in -t, the third person plural in -nt. The endings which show the person and number of the verb are called personal endings.</em></p><p>30. Learn the following verbs and write the plural of each. The personal pronouns <em>he</em>, <em>she</em>, <em>it</em>, etc., which are necessary in the inflection of the English verb, are not needed in the Latin, because the personal endings take their place. Of course, if the verbâ€™s subject is expressed we do not translate the personal ending by a pronoun; thus nauta pugnatis translated <em>the sailor fights</em>, not <em>the sailor he fights</em>.</p><ul><li>ama-t</li></ul><p><em>he (she, it)</em></p></div> </div>
