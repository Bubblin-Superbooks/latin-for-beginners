However, the agreement between the adjective and its noun does <em>not</em> mean that they must have the same termination. If the adjective and the noun belong to different declensions, the terminations will, in many cases, not be the same. For example, nauta, <em>sailor</em>, is masculine and belongs to the first declension. The masculine form of the adjective bonusis of the second declension. Consequently, <em>a good sailor</em> is nauta bonus. So, <em>the wicked farmer</em> is agricola malus.
