In a Latin sentence the most emphatic place is the <em>first</em>; next in importance is the <em>last</em>; the weakest point is the <em>middle</em>. Generally the <em>subject</em> is the most important word, and is placed <em>first</em>; usually the <em>verb</em> is the next in importance, and is placed <em>last</em>. The other words of the sentence stand between these two in the order of their importance. Hence the normal order of words—that is, where no unusual emphasis is expressed—is as follows:</p><ul><li>subject_—_modifiers of the subject_—_indirect object_—_direct object_—_adverb_—_verb</li></ul><p>Changes from the normal order are frequent, and are due to the desire for throwing emphasis upon some word or phrase. <em>Notice the order of the</em> 30 <em>Latin words when you are translating, and imitate it when you are turning English into Latin.</em></p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">2.
